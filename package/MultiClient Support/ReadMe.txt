MultiClient Support

- You must use "9900_Poison_Pack_Feature Tweaks".
- You must use a custom launcher.
- It should be included in the package you downloaded. It is called "MabiDirectLaunch.exe" (by Blade3575).
	How to use it:
		1. Double-click.
		2. Done. Mabinogi should be launched.
		3. If it does not work, go to your Mabinogi folder where Client.exe is located at.
		4. Double click default.reg.
		5. Try step 1 again.
		
	MabiDirectLaunch should always work as long as your game is installed correctly.
	If not, try placing MabiDirectLaunch.exe in the folder where Client.exe is present.
	
	If it still does not work, Google "MabiLauncher Plus" or "Power Patcher".
